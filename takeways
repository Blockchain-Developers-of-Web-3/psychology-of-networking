Networking is two-way. Be an active listener, show genuine interest, be positive.

Spontaneous Trait Transference

The way you talk about others is the same way others will think of you.

When you talk to one person in a bad way, those people who heard you will also associate that "bad" trait with you.

When you do something to someone, people think you can do it to them.

It is called Spontaneous Trait Transference.

Take your time to network with people

When you have a spare 5 minutes don't start a conservation, you can't genuinely listen to them.

You just leave the conversation hanging and it isn't fruitful for the both you.
